<h1>Program</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>On behalf of the Organising Committee I invite you to submit an abstract to the Australian and New Zealand Association of Health Professional Educators Annual Conference in Melbourne from Monday the 24<sup>th</sup> to Thursday the 27<sup>th</sup> of June 2013. The theme of this year?s conference is the <strong>Professional Development of Health Professional Educators</strong>.  If we are to develop a competent and sustainable health workforce fit for our current and future health care needs it is critical that our response is underpinned by the development of a competent and sustainable educator workforce. The ANZAHPE 2013 conference will focus on the professional development of our teachers and examine effective approaches in health professional education including simulation, clinical supervision, peer learning, inter-professional learning, assessment and education research skills.  With the assistance of an outstanding international and local conference faculty the conference will offer a variety of stimulating activities for those involved in health professional education.<p>

<h2>Pre-Conference Workshops</h2>
<p>Pre-Conference Workshops will be held on <strong>Monday 24th June</strong> at the Sebel, Albert Park. Workshop details and registrations will be updated via the conference website regularly.</p>
<h4>Workshop 1: 0900 – 1200</h4>
<p>Building Healthcare Education Research Capacity: a Workshop for Education Researchers, Practitioners, and Leaders<br>
  <em>Prof Charlotte Rees</em></p>
<p>Widespread perception exists that healthcare education research lacks theoretical and methodological sophistication and rigour (e.g. Rees & Monrouxe 2010; Roberts & Conn 2009).  Although numerous initiatives and models for education research capacity building have been developed over the last decade (e.g. Christie & Menter 2009; Murray et al. 2009), criticisms include their narrow focus on building the expertise of individual researchers through formal approaches, plus their lack of rigorous evaluation (e.g. Biesta et al. 2011).  Through a combination of presentations, cases and hands-on group work, this workshop will facilitate discussion about what research capacity building is and its drivers, different models, challenges and how to evaluate initiatives.</p>

<h4>Workshop 2: 0900 – 1200</h4>
<p>Learners in Difficulty - a Faculty Development Priority - Introduces Key Themes, Develops a Diagnostic and Management Framework<br>
  <em>Dr Ian Curran</em></p>
<p>This workshop will give faculty members and educational leads an opportunity to explore the challenging area of managing learners in difficulty. This workshop will introduce a practical diagnostic and management framework for diagnosing the resident in difficulty.</p>
<p>We will explore several important and inter-related themes including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recognising the student in difficulty</li>
  <li>The challenge for faculty</li>
  <li>The aetiology of students in difficulty</li>
  <li>A diagnostic and management framework</li>
  <li>A robust communication model to respond to this challenging area of practice.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will explore 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' professional behavior. Highlight the importance of effective communication and assertive feedback in professional development.</p>
<p>This workshop will begin with a discussion of the participants’ personal experiences, and then explore the impact of learners in difficulty. Themes and patterns will be captured. Drawing upon his personal experience from the UK National Health Service causes of why practitioners get into difficulty will be used to create a conceptual framework for diagnosing and managing learners/students/trainees/professionals in difficulty.</p>
<p>The challenge of difficult conversations will also be discussed and a pragmatic communication model introduced.</p>
<p class="notify">Cost: $88.00 per person</p>
<h4>Workshop 3: 0900 – 1200</h4>
<p>Rethinking Feedback<br><em>A/Prof Elizabeth Molloy</em></p>
<p>We all experience the influence of feedback in our working lives, and there is strong evidence to suggest that it is an important mechanism in learning. Why is it then that learners complain more about feedback than any other element in their programs? This workshop explores the ‘problem of feedback’ and identifies and untangles some of the reasons as to why it is typically hard to give, hard to take, and hard to use. Analysis of feedback studies in health professions education and key conceptual frameworks will be presented to help distil the key properties needed for effective feedback.  Feedback is positioned as an activity for learners, rather than an act of ‘telling’ that is imposed on learners.  Participants will have an opportunity to rethink what practices may best benefit learners, and will experiment with these strategies.</p>

<h4>Workshop 4: 1300 – 1600</h4>
<p>Measuring Assessment Quality and Stability using the Rasch Model<br><em>Dr Deborah O’Mara & Mrs Imogene Rothnie</em></p>
<p>This workshop will provide a brief introduction to assessment psychometrics, and in particular the Rasch model from the Item Response Theory (IRT) family of models for estimation of item difficulty and person ability.  Guidelines for applying Rasch estimation using Winsteps software will be demonstrated with medical student assessments comprised of multiple choice questions. We will work through some practical examples of data preparation for Winsteps, item analysis, including estimating item difficulty, point-biserial coefficients and test equating using item anchors.  Much of the workshop will be interactive to provide participants with experience in interpreting Rasch output with de-identified medical education data. We will also demonstrate how to collate item statistics over time through our ExamBank program. Our aim is that participants leave the workshop with a new set of tools for improving the quality of summative assessments in their medical or other health professional program. No prior statistical knowledge is required.</p>

<h4>Workshop 5: 1300 - 1600</h4>
<p>Teaching on the Run: Facilitating Inter professional Education in the Clinical Setting<br><em>Fiona Lake</em></p>
<p>Increasingly, clinicians from across the professions are finding themselves responsible for students from professions other than their own.  Whether in small or large groups with single or mixed professions present, it is harder to draw on familiar teaching models and scripts at short notice and be sure they are what the learner needs. The workshop will address the definition and aims of inter professional learning, strategies for interacting in an IPE setting, and will build your confidence to supervise learners from a range of professions.</p>
<p class="notify">Cost: $88.00 per person</p>
<h4>Workshop 6: 1300 - 1600</h4>
<p>Theories that Inform Educational Practice<br><em>A/Prof Margaret Bearman, Prof Debra Nestel</em></p>
<p>Educational practice, including the design of activities, is often undertaken without close examination of associated educational theories. Educational theory provides valuable guidance regarding the strengths and weaknesses of particular approaches. This workshop introduces: the notion of educational theory in health professional education; how educators’ own views of the learning process shape their orientations towards particular educational theories; how to use theory to better develop educational practice. Participants will discuss key learning theories relevant to health professional education and undertake activities to use theory to guide educational decisions.</p>
