<h4>Presentation formats</h4>
<p>As its core ANZAHPE values communication and importantly active participation. Conference presentations strive to embody effective communication and encourage interaction between society members, guests, presenters and attendees. Presentation formats are designed to inform active participation with specified time allocation for group discussion and interaction.</p>
<h4>Poster presentations</h4>
<p>Posters will be displayed for the duration of the conference. Each poster will be allocated a 1 metre wide x 2 metres high board and the poster must fit within this area. Poster presenters will be given 10 minutes to present and discuss your poster during the Conference program. Poster presentation details and specifications will be provided in the speaker briefing notes.</p>
<h4>Small group workshop</h4>
<p>Presenters will be allocated 30 minutes including 10 minute presentation time to highlight the main points, followed by a 20 minute discussion.</p>
<h4>Personally Arranged Learning Sessions (PeArLs)</h4>
<p>PeArL sessions will be allocated 20 - 30 minutes with 10 minutes to define the topic plus 20 minutes for open discussion. PeArL sessions will be limited to 3 concise presentation slides. PeArL sessions allow an opportunity for those who are developing ideas, those who are taking ideas from development into implementation and those who are planning evaluation of their ideas, to share, discuss and gain insight into their positions by tapping into the wisdom and experience of others.</p>
<h4>Oral presentations</h4>
<p>Oral Presentations will be allocated 15 minutes. This will include 12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for questions.</p>
<h4>Workshops</h4>
<p>Conference workshops will be allocated either 45 or 90 minutes as requested by the presenter(s). Workshops are working sessions with defined objectives, such as defining the scope and nature of an education issue, developing a plan of action, solving a problem, or demonstration of educational innovations with hands-on experience.</p>
<h4>Presenter registration</h4>
<p>Submissions are accepted on the basis that all presenting authors must register and pay the appropriate conference fee by 8 April 2013. Co-presenters are allowed, but must register for the minimum daily registration on the day of their presentation if they wish to present. Where there are multiple presenters it is important the presentation time is strictly adhered to so enough time is available for questions. Speakers need to meet their own travel and accommodation costs. It will be assumed any presenter not registered by this date has withdrawn and their abstract will be removed from the program.</p>
<h4>Full paper publication</h4>
<p>We encourage presenters to submit their full papers for consideration for publication in the ANZAHPE journal - Focus on Health Professional Education: A Multidisciplinary Journal.</p>
<h4>AV equipment</h4>
<p>A data projector, computer (IBM compatible), whiteboard and laser pointer will be available in each room. Presenters are not able to use their own laptop to run their presentation.</p>
<p>Presenters will be required to take their PowerPoint presentations to the conference on a CD-ROM or USB memory stick.  A speakers preparation room with an audiovisual technician will load your presentation.</p>
